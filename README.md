# AnyType Custom UI Style Development Proposal

## Overview

The objective of this project is to enhance the user experience within AnyType by introducing a custom UI style. The proposed solution involves creating a versatile and user-friendly interface that allows users to choose between different builds with ease.

## Technical Framework

AnyType is developed using [ElectronJS](https://www.electronjs.org/), a robust framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Simplifying User Experience

To simplify the customization process and make it more accessible, the following approach will be implemented:

### 1. Single CSS File

A unified CSS file will be created to control the UI across various devices, such as phones and PCs. Utilizing @media queries, particularly Bootstrap media sizes, will ensure responsiveness without the need for a complex compilation process.

### 2. Unique @media Styles

Each @media query will be meticulously crafted to provide a unique and optimized style for different screen sizes. This ensures a seamless user experience across a variety of devices.

### 3. Custom Styling for Object Pages

Individual object pages will receive custom styling, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of specific components.

### 4. Custom Fonts Styles

A carefully curated selection of custom font styles will be integrated, allowing users to personalize their experience further.

### 5. Right-to-Left (RTL) Support

Ensuring RTL support is a priority, acknowledging the importance of catering to diverse language and reading preferences.

### 6. Streamlined Process

The proposed solution eliminates the need for complex SCSS or JavaScript configurations, relying solely on one CSS file for UI control.

## Implementation

The implementation will follow a systematic approach, focusing on the outlined components to deliver a cohesive and visually appealing custom UI style for AnyType's main page.

## Conclusion

By implementing this custom UI style, AnyType aims to offer users a seamless and personalized experience, aligning with modern design standards and user preferences. The proposed framework ensures simplicity in customization while maintaining a high level of flexibility and creativity.
