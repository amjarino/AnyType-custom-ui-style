# AnyType custom ui style

Create a custom anytype ui style for Any type main page with css

---

So AnyType is Build with [electronjs](https://www.electronjs.org/) which is a framework for  Building a cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

why we cannot make thing easy and more frieandly by creating an option where user can choose bitween difrent build in ui, i guse is much easer , no copmile prosseing, no scss, no js, only one css file, for controling ui , fonts, comonents type, blocks...

 ## my idea for this is like this: 

   - one CSS file  controling UI for with difrents for phones,pc..., using  @media query (i'm gonna use bootstrap media sizes).
   - each @media has a unique style
   - 
   - 
   -
